### charAt
What it does: method returns a new string with a single code unit located at the specified index in the string

How it works: the method takes the target index as an argument. The index should be within the range of 0 and the string.length - 1. If the index is out of range, method returns an empty string. If the index passed can't be converted to an integer or none is provided, the default is 0.

Time Complexity: linear O(n)

Examples:
```
let goal = "sleep seven hours nightly"
let firstE = goal.charAt(2) --> "e"

let outOfRange = goal.charAt(300) --> ""

let space = goal.charAt(5) --> " "
```
